Question 1:  A card is a component of a deck. A deck is comprised of cards in a similar way to how arrays might be comprised of integers. Cards within a deck can be moved. 

Question 2: It contains 6 cards.

Question 3: the array for point values would look like: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11]. For suits, the array would look like ["hearts", "diamonds", "clubs", "spades"]. For ranks, it would be ["2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","Jack","Queen","King","Ace"].

Question 4: The order doesn't matter. Any permutation will still initialize every card.
